## Languages recommendations
<details>
  <summary><h3>`.dikc` language</h3></summary>
  
1. **Instructions**
   - int var = value/var (initialize new int variable to `value` or value of variable `var`)
   - bool var = value/var (same)
   - var = value/var (same, but for existing variable)
   - if (condition) { do this }
   - while (condition) { do this }

2. **Other info**
   - variable names must only contain alphanumeric characters (not even `_`)
   - int variables are 8 bits, bool variables are 0 or 1 (and not true or false)
   - setting an variable value to `undefined` makes it reserve a memory slot for that variable
   - operands:
      - +-*/ for usual operations
      - `&` for AND
      - `|` for OR
      - `^` for XOR
   - /!\ No calculation priorities yet
</details>

  <summary><h3>`.ass`embly language</h3></summary>

1. **Instructions**
   - LDI a value (set value of int at address `a` to `value`)
   - CPI a value (copy value of int `a` to `b`)
   - LDB a value (LDI but for a bool variable)
   - CPB a value (CPI but for bool)
   - ADD a b c (add the values of int of address `a` and `b` and store result in address `c`)
   - (same syntax for SUB, MUL, DIV)
   - IFF a goto (if bool value is 1, go to line nÂ°goto)
   - EQU a b c (if int `a` and `b` are equal, bool of address `c` will be 1)
   - LES a b c (same, but `c` is 1 when `a`<`b`)
   - LGC AND/ORR/XOR a b c (logic operation of `a` and `b` stored into bool of address `c`)
   - SRC a b (turn screen pixel (a, b) on, `a` and `b` are INT addresses)
   - RST (reset all screen pixels to off)
   - END (end the program execution)

2. **Other info**
   - same as for DIKC (except concerning variables)
   - addresses are integers
   - to always redirect without the need of using a bool var, use `IFF 8 goto`
   - lines are counted from the top, of index 0
   - screen coordinates are 4-bit integers
</details>

## Requirements

1. **Python**
   - Python 3.x
   - compiler: `time` (already in the Standard Library)
   - simulator: `pygame>=2.0.0`
2. **Minecraft**
   - Minecraft 1.17+
   - Fabric
   - Fabric API
   - Malilib
   - Litematica
   - (recommended, to speed up the game): Carpet mod, Sodium/Lithium/Phosphor

Happy coding!

(I hope everything works)
